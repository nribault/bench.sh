# Bench.sh

### Benchmark your linux system

With this script, you are able to view system information, test the network and disk speed of your Linux server. 
I also implemented Geekbench benchmark.

You have to be root to run onoe of these commands.

```bash
wget -qO- https://bit.ly/39E6MGz | bash
```
or
```bash
curl -Lso- https://bit.ly/39E6MGz | bash
```
